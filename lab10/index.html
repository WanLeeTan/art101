		<h1>Lab 10: JavaScript Events and Forms</h1>
		<p>Working with your partner, experiment with JS events.</p>
		<h1>Challenges</h1>
		<p>Overall this lab was easier than the previous. The only challenges I faced
    was trying to get the button to work which I fixed super fast it was just coded
    in the wrong order. But yeah other than that it was fine.</p>
		<h1>Results</h1>
    <p>This program sorts your input from the numbers to the letters.</p>
    <input type = "text" id = "my-input">
    <button id = "my-button">
      Enter
    </button>
    <div id = output>
		</div>
