		<h1>Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
		<p>Working with your partner, experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks.</p>
		<h1>Challenges</h1>
		<p> I didnt know which to follow put the javascript call above or below because in
    Task 1 it said do it in the head but then some screenshots down the line imply otherwise
    so I just did both. I tried Task X but I didnt know what I was doing so i just
    gave up on it.</p>
		<h1>Results</h1>
		<p>Go to console to see the output or just look below.</p>
    <div class = output>
