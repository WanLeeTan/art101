    <h1>Challenges</h1>
    <div id = challenges>
      Task 1 and 2 went smoothly. Although Task 3 was confusing and I just based
      it off the lecture notes to get an idea of what we were supposed to do. I
      had a problem where the buttons was only changing one of the text and the
      fix was just duplicating the ids and changing them so they were different.

    <h1>Results</h1>
    <div id = results>
      You can switch the colors of the text with the buttons below.
    </div>

    <button class = "purple">
      Purple
    </button>

    <button class = "pink">
      Pink
    </button>
